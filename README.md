# Music App - Offline Music Player for Android

## Description

It provides a clean user interface to browse songs, control playback, and enjoy music with a persistent notification player. The app focuses on simplicity and a good user experience for offline music listening.

## Features

*   **Playlist Management:**
    *   View all available songs.
    *   Create and manage custom playlists.

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Clean and intuitive Material Design.
    *   Displays song title, artist, and album art (with placeholders if not available).

## Usage

### Basic Music Playback
1.  Grant necessary permissions (e.g., Read External Storage) when prompted.
2.  The app will scan and display music files from your device.
3.  Tap on a song to start playing.
4.  Use the player controls at the bottom (or in the notification) to manage playback.
5.  Explore sorting options for your playlist.

## Known Limitations

*   Currently only supports local music playback; no streaming features.
*   Basic playlist management is now available with creation, editing, and song management features.
*   The `playNext()` and `playPrevious()` in the `MusicService` are currently reliant on `MainActivity` for the core logic of selecting the actual next/previous song.

## Tech Stack

*   **UI:** Android XML Layouts, Material Components
*   **Core Components:**
    *   `Service` for background playback (`MusicService`)
